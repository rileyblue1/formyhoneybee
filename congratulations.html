            <p>The day we met is blurry, but I know it was the second-best day of my life right after the day we will finally meet again. I know you have been stressing over your studies, and I'm here to help. You can always rant to me, and I'll listen. Even when we're mad at each other, talking to you is still my favorite part of the day. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

        <div class="text-container">
            <p>I love how we share the same interests and dislikes, the same obsession with fries and chicken, and our absolute hate towards fish (eww fish). You're my other half, and without you, I'm incomplete. Once you hold my hand, I will never let go. üíï</p>

            <p>Theres ups and downs in life and so are in relationships . I promise to always stand by your side, to lift up your mood when you're down, and love you unconditionally. May death be the only thing to tear us apart</p>

            <p>Every little moment with you is a memory I cherish. From silly jokes to deep conversations to being angry at each other or annoyed our little fights and disagreements , Not a second of my life is wasted when were together. I love you more than any language in the world could express üíò</p>

            <p>Your so kind to people you often forget the most important things to you. You try to be nice even when they're not. I envy you for that. People have a weird way of showing apreciation or anything like that. I know they dont mean it like they're saying but the words are still too heavy for me </p>
