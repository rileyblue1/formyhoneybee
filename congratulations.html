        <div class="text-container">
            <p>The day we met is blurry, but I know it was the second-best day of my life right after the day we will finally meet again. I know you have been stressing over your studies, and I'm here to help. You can always rant to me, and I'll listen. Even when we're mad at each other, talking to you is still my favorite part of the day. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

        <div class="text-container">
            <p>I love how we share the same interests and dislikes, the same obsession with fries and chicken, and our absolute hate towards fish (eww fish). You're my other half, and without you, I'm incomplete. Once you hold my hand, I will never let go. üíï</p>

    <!-- Third Box -->

        <div class="text-container">
            <p>Your laughter defines my joy. Although we didn't call much, every time we did, I couldn't remember any of my past that used to bother me. It felt like it was always like this, like we were never strangers, always together. üíñ</p>
        </div>

    <!-- Fourth Box -->
    <div class="container">

        <div class="text-container">
            <p>There are ups and downs in life, and so are in relationships. I promise to always stand by your side, to lift up your mood when you're down, and love you unconditionally. May death be the only thing to tear us apart.</p>

    <!-- Fifth Box -->
    <div class="container">
        <img src="7.jfif" alt="Photo" class="photo">
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>Every little moment with you is a memory I cherish. From silly jokes to deep conversations to being angry at each other or annoyed, our little fights and disagreements, not a second of my life is wasted when we're together. I love you more than any language in the world could express. üíò</p>

    <!-- Sixth Box -->
    <div class="container">
        <img src="8.jpg" alt="Photo" class="photo">
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>You're so kind to people you often forget the most important things to you. You try to be nice even when they're not. I envy you for that. People have a weird way of showing appreciation or anything like that. I know they don‚Äôt mean it like they're saying, but the words are still too heavy for me.</p>

        <div class="text-container">
            <p>It all feels like a dream I never want to wake up from. How will it be when we're together? I might have to ask you to pinch me every second for a year (or more). Your mom may not understand us, which is valid considering how protective she is towards you, but we understand each other like two pages from the same book.</p>

            <p>Your always saying you feel like you dont deserve me and how i deserve better. But its not only about you you need to take into account that i choose to love you if you deserve me or not i dont care about my worth. Doubt yourself and your doubting my love.When i asked you if you would blindly believe my words.i dont know if you remember that.Trust my decision and i promise baby you'll see what i mean.</p>

            <p>Your pretty unfair babe.Keeping all to yourself and not giving anyone else the chance to grab me? And hush. I dont wanna hear that i can meet whoever i want. I want you to make decisions for me(im pretty bad at making decisions you see). actually i wouldnt say that i made the best decision.And that was to fall in love with you.</p>

Not much to write today the only thing on my mind rn is that one photo(yk which nyeheh)Maybe i'll write "300 reasons why i love you" to beat your 200 reasons next time</p>
