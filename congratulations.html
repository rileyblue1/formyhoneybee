            <p>The day we met is blurry, but I know it was the second-best day of my life right after the day we will finally meet again. I know you have been stressing over your studies, and I'm here to help. You can always rant to me, and I'll listen. Even when we're mad at each other, talking to you is still my favorite part of the day. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
